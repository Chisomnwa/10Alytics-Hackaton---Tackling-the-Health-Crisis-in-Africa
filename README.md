# Tackling-the-Health-Crisis-in-Africa

I worked on the case study; Tackling the Health Crisis in Africa and Provided recommendations on how to curb this crisis using **Power BI.**

Below is a document describing the case study and the datasets.

I cleaned, andlyzed and visualized the provided datasets using Power BI. Read my blog on this post to understand the process I took in cleaning and validating the data, building data model, and analysing and visualizing the data using only Power BI.

You can interact with the dashboard I built showcasing the insights into the causes of the health crisis ravaging the Africa nations.
