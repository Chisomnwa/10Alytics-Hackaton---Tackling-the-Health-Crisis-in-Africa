I worked on the case study; Tackling the Health Crisis in Africa and provided recommendations on how to curb this crisis using **Power BI.**

You can interact with the insightful [dashboard]() report I built showcasing the hidden insights into the causes of the health crisis ravaging the Africa nations.
